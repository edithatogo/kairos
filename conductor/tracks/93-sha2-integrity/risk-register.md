# Risk register

Severity: Low / Medium / High / Critical.

| Risk | Severity | Control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Added complexity without benefit | High | Value gate and explicit reject/defer outcome |
| Changed contract or false acceptance | High | Independent standard empty/abc/multiblock/boundary-length vectors; Python hashlib or another independent implementation; single-bit corruption, truncated/invalid digest, full-byte coverage including high tick bits; old-format rejection/version tests. Do not treat the old custom hash as a SHA-256 oracle. |
| Ownership or migration cycle | High | Exact claims and dependency-sequencing register |
