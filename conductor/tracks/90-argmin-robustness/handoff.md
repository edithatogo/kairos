# Handoff

Updated: 2026-10-22. Maturity: planned; adoption decision pending.

## Summary

Separate dependency track registered. No runtime change, installation or accepted implementation phase.

## Files changed

Planning folder and coordinated registry/policy surfaces only.

## Contracts consumed

[Value policy](../../dependency-value-policy.md), existing owner contracts and prerequisites in spec.md.

## Contracts changed

Prospective replacement boundaries only; no runtime API changed.

## Tests added

Independent future tests specified in test-matrix.md; planning validators only this pass.

## Known risks

No adoption to replace a trivial objective function or absent optimisation loop; identify concrete code deletion/avoided implementation first.

## Follow-up issues

Record exact existing consumer, baseline and adopt/no-go decision in Phase 0. Parent adoption requires verified upstream receipts and its own claim.

## Integration notes

See [programme](../../robust-dependencies.md). Worktree integration, local main, hosted CI and runtime acceptance remain distinct.

## Phase closeout evidence

Pending: `$conductor-review`, accepted fixes, rejected findings, command/cwd/commit SHA/toolchain/seed/input hashes, exit codes/artifacts, pushed ref or blocker and next-phase decision. Use `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/validate_conductor_git_closeout.ps1 -RequireCleanWorkingTree` before advancement.
