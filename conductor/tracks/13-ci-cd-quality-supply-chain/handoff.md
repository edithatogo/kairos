# Handoff — 13 CI/CD, Code Quality & Supply Chain

## Summary

CI and supply-chain gates now cover core Rust quality, binding smoke workflows, conformance fixture validation, benchmark smoke checks, dependency policy, and workflow security checks. This pass also wires the Track 07-13 hardening validator into the conformance workflow and keeps release/registry actions out of local validation.

## Contracts changed

None.

## Tests added

Workflow existence checks, Rust metadata checks, cargo-deny/audit gates, Dependabot coverage, CI skip guard checks, offline conformance checks, Track 07-13 hardening, and benchmark smoke checks are documented in `test-matrix.md`.

## Known risks

Binding, package, benchmark, and fuzz jobs require checked-in manifests or harness directories before their workflow jobs can run successfully.

## Integration notes

Tracks 07-13, 14, 15, 20, 25, and 28 consume these gates directly. Keep future workflow changes aligned with `conductor/quality-gates.md` and `conductor/delivery-readiness-checklist.md`.

No release, registry, or remote publication side effects were performed.
